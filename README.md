Ray Tracing in C++

## Goals
* Still image rendering
* Refactor the code to be closer to what you'd like to see yourself
* 64 frame animated gif, looping
	* Use ideas you used to use regarding animated checkerboards, possibly the cubic spiral checkerboard with everysurface very reflective.
	* Possibly several spheres moving in an animated recurring spiral pattern, using radial coords and a sine function for the radius
